<ul><li><h3>Why do I love to eat pizza?</li></ul></h3>
<li>The combinations and the cooking process enhance the taste of already-tasty ingredients. &#x1F355 </li>
<li>Pizza is one of the world’s most popular foods. &#x1F354</li>
<li>In the United States, 350 slices are eaten every second, while 40 percent of Americans eat pizza at least once a week. &#x1F369</li>
<li>There’s a reason pizza is so popular. Humans are drawn to foods that are fatty, sweet, rich and complex. Pizza has all of these components. Cheese is fatty, meat toppings tend to be rich and the sauce is sweet. &#x1F36A</li>
<li>Pizza toppings are also packed with a compound called glutamate, which can be found in the tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni and sausage. When glutamate hits our tongues, it tells our brains to get excited and to crave more of it. This compound actually causes our mouths to water in anticipation of the next bite. &#x1F35F</li>
<li>Then there are the combinations of ingredients. Cheese and tomato sauce are like a perfect pairing. On their own, they taste pretty good. But according to culinary scientists, they contain flavor compounds that taste even better when eaten together. &#x1F967</li>
<li>Another quality of pizza that makes it so delicious: Its ingredients become brown while cooking in the oven. &#x1F953</li>
<li>Foods turn brown and crispy when we cook them because of two chemical reactions. &#x1F60B</li>
